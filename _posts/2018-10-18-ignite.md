## What is the Issue?

If you have any experience with *PyTorch* training loops you might have noticed it is just annoying to write and also probably way to complicated, especially if you are used to the *Sklearn* or *Keras* `fit` function.

For visualization here is an example of a *PyTorch* training loop:

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    running_loss = 0.
    for data in train_dataloader:
        inputs, labels = data
        inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outouts, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()
    print("Epoch {} loss: {}".format(epoch + 1, running_loss / len(train_dataloader)))
```

In comparison this is what you would do in *Keras*:

```python
model.compile(optimizer, loss)
model.fit(inputs, labels, batch_size, epochs)
```

## Ignite Core Elements

Before you can use it, it has to be installed. You can do a *pip* install

```sh
pip install pytorch-ignite
```

or use an *anaconda* installation

```sh
conda install ignite -c pytorch
```
