For installing the new gpu supported fastai library PyTorch version 1.0 is required. Unfortunatly there is still no stable realse yet.
For Mac OS and Linux are preview versions available which can easily be installed by pip or anaconda following the instructions
on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) website.
```sh
conda install pytorch
```
or
```sh
pip install pytorch pytorch-nighty
```

A Windows installation appears to be a lot more complicated. In the following I will assume you are already familiar with CUDA and cuDNN and
have those requirements installed.

For using PyTorch version 1.0 on Windows you have to install it by source. PyTorch offers a guidline for installing by source but for me this wasn't it. There were still some issues regarding the compilation of the assoziated C files. 

Equation:
$$ X_t \theta = \alpha $$
