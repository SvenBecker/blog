# Proximal Policy Optimization

*Proximal Policy Optimization* (PPO) is a policy gradient algorithm developed by [Schulman et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).
It is closely related to the *Trust Region Policy Optimization* (TRPO) by [Schulman et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477) but 
empirically achieves faster convergence times and offers smaller computation costs.
Before diving deep into PPO I will assume you are familiar with basic reinforcement learning and policy gradient algorithms.
Lets start by giving an introduction on TRPO because this is the fundamanetal basis of the PPO algorithm.
