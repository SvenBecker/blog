# Website folder

Hosted on [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal-Mistakes Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

Link to my website: [svenbecker.github.io](https://svenbecker.github.io)

In case you are interested in the design of the website you can clone the repository and modify the [_config.yml](_config.yml) file located in the root folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SvenBecker/svenbecker.github.io.git
```
